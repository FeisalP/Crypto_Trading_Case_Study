# Cryptocurrency_Trading_Case_Study
A data analysis case study using PostgreSQL
<br />
<br />

In this project I have initially used pgAdmin IDE to write the SQL queries.
<br />
<br />

The schema for this project includes 3 tables from a dataset provided by Danny Ma as part of his SQL Masterclass:
1. members.csv
2. prices.csv
3. transactions.csv
